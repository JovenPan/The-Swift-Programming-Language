# About Swift
# Swift介绍

Swift is a new programming language for iOS and OS X apps that builds on the best of C and Objective-C, without the constraints of C compatibility.Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun.Swift’s clean slate, backed by the mature and much-loved Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, is an opportunity to reimagine how software development works.

Swift是一款为iOS和OS X 应用打造的新式编程语言，它吸取了C语言和Objective-C语言的精华，同时完美兼容C语言。Swift采用了安全编程模式，增加了许多现代语言的特性，使编程工作更加简单，灵活，有趣。一款重新设计的语言，再加上成熟并且深受欢迎的Cocoa框架和Cocoa Touch框架，Swift为软件开发工作带来了无限遐想。


Swift has been years in the making. Apple laid the foundation for Swift by advancing our existing compiler, debugger, and framework infrastructure. We simplified memory management with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Our framework stack, built on the solid base of Foundation and Cocoa, has been modernized and standardized throughout. Objective-C itself has evolved to support blocks, collection literals, and modules, enabling framework adoption of modern language technologies without disruption. Thanks to this groundwork, we can now
introduce a new language for the future of Apple software development.

Swift已经持续研发多年了。苹果公司通过多年对已有编译器，调试器和基础架构的改进经验为Swift奠定了基础。我们通过ARC(Automatic Reference Counting，自动引用计数)简化内存管理。以Cocoa框架作为坚实的基础，我们的框架堆栈已然在各方面都更加的现代化和标准化了。Objective-C在发展过程中支持了块，字面量集合，模块，使框架与现代语言的衔接不至于中断。多亏了它，使我们能够向大家推荐为苹果软件开发的未来而生的编程语言----Swift。


Swift feels familiar to Objective-C developers. It adopts the readability of Objective-C’s named parameters and the power of Objective-C’s dynamic object model. It provides seamless access to existing Cocoa frameworks and mix-and-match interoperability with Objective-C code. Building from this common ground, Swift introduces many new features and unifies the procedural and object-oriented portions of the language.

Swift对于Object-C开发人员非常友好。它采用了Objective-C的参数命名和动态对象模型。它与现有的Cocoa框架无缝对接并与Objective-C实现了Mix-and-Match（混入内嵌式）互通。基于此，Swift还引入了一些新特性并结合了语言的面向过程和面向对象的功能。


Swift is friendly to new programmers. It is the first industrial-quality systems programming language that is as expressive and enjoyable as a scripting language. It supports playgrounds, an innovative feature that allows programmers to experiment with Swift code and see the results immediately, without the overhead of building and running an app.

Swift对于新手也是友好的，它是工业级品质的系统编程语言，而且像脚本语言一般生动有趣。它提供了Playground，允许程序开发人员实时预览效果，无需构建和运行整个app。


Swift combines the best in modern language thinking with wisdom from the wider Apple engineering culture. The compiler is optimized for performance, and the language is optimized for development, without compromising on either. It’s designed to scale from “hello, world” to an entire operating system. All this makes Swift a sound future investment for developers and for Apple.

Swift融入了博大的苹果的工程文化中富有智慧的现代语言思维。从“hello，world”开始到整个语言系统，编译器优化了性能，语言提升了开发效率，无需任何妥协，这一切，让Swift成为了开发者与Apple未来实用的选择。


Swift is a fantastic way to write iOS and OS X apps, and will continue to evolve with new features and capabilities. Our goals for Swift are ambitious. We can’t wait to see what you create with it.”

Swift是编写iOS和OS X应用的绝美方式，我们会持续引入新特性和新功能。我们对Swift充满了信息。我们已经迫不及待的想看到你用它来做点什么。
